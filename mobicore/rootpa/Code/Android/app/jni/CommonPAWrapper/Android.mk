# makefile for building the provisioning agent JNI wrapper for using the Common part
# from Android Java code. build the code by executing
# $NDK_ROOT/ndk-build in the folder where this file resides

#
# Naturally the right way to build this is using build script in Build folder.
# It then uses this file in turn.
